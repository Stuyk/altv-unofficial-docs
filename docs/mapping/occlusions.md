# Occlusions

Delete all the occlusion data. It is not needed.

This is `old data` from PlayStation and Xbox era.

## Can't See Occlusions in Code Walker?

Update your CodeWalker version and get the latest from Discord.

_If for some strange reason you still can't see them maybe they got removed at some point in time. Ignore occlusions at this point._
