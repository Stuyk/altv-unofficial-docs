# alt:V Unofficial Documentation Files

These are the files that are used as a submodule for [https://altv.stuyk.com/](https://altv.stuyk.com/). Feel free to fork this repository and make a pull request to contribute. All files should **ALWAYS** be in markdown format. No other `.md` files types than `.md` should be added into this repository.

Inside of a `markdown` file is `Front Matter` which helps figure out where a file belongs. Creating a new category or adding it to an existing one is as easy as setting the `prefix` of your `Front Matter`.

## Example Front Matter

This goes at the top of your markdown file.

```
---
title: 'Radians and Degrees'
description: 'Help to understand GTA rotation types'
prefix: '[Concepts]'

# Blah Blah Blah

Something about blah blah blah and why blah blah blah is blah.
